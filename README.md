# Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System

In this project, I've learned a functional safety framework based on the [ISO 26262](https://www.iso.org/standard/43464.html) standard to ensure that vehicles is safe, both at the system and component levels. The framework covers how to create and conduct:

1. a safety plan document
2. a hazard analysis and risk assessment
3. a functional safety concept document
4. a technical safety document, and
5. a software requirements and architecture documents

I applied the framework and the concept to create a report that documents the functional safety of a lane assistance system. The five documents are simplified versions of what a functional safety manager would create as part of a safety case. 

Analyzing and documenting system safety is critical for autonomous vehicle development. These are skills that often only experienced automotive engineers possess.

The scope of this project is not to do an entire functional safety analysis from scratch. Instead, I used the lane assistance example given in the lecture to complete the documentation. Please see the file Project_Instructions.pdf.
